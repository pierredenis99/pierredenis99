Hi, I'm @pierredenis99, welcome to my github! 
I'm interested in everything relating to machine learning and deep learning. 
I'm currently completing a master's degree at Polytechnique Montreal in Computer Science. 
I would love to collaborate on projects using time-series algorithms and NLP's, as I have some previous experience.
Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/pierre-denis99/
